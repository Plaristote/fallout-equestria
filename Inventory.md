# Introduction #

The inventory from Fallout will not fit every aspect of the Equestrian wasteland.
Some things have got to change, and that's the occasion to make the system more interesting.
Following the lead of Fallout Equestria, the wording will change (the inventory will be called the saddlebags, the armor will be referred to as the barding).

# Details #

## Inventory ##
The inventory itself will be presented much like the one from Fallout Tactics (e.g.: pretty much the same as Fallout 1 and 2, but presenting the contents using several columns instead of a single one).

Another possibility is to use an inventory system much like the one from Reisdent Evil, where you must organize your items so they fit. This will require a bit more code, but not too much, and provide a more realistic inventory.

[Warning: turns out this probably won't be done:] The inventory will be used to put your barding on, but also to put on a battle-saddle (the subject of battle-saddle is also covered in this entry).

## Barding ##
Barding will inherit everything from the first Fallout : Armor Class, and a specific resistance to each kind of attack. Such as the Power Armor, they may change your characters statistics.

Something that should appear with the barding is the a quick-access inventory.
On my opinion, equipped object should only be weapons. Everything else that, in Fallout, would need to be equipped, would be accessible here from the pockets of your barding.

Each barding may have a different amount of storage. The storage can only be used for items such as potions, drugs, and the likes.

## Battle Saddle ##
The battle saddle will be another great novelty.

Battle Saddle will be equipped the same way the barding is. They will have several modifiers that will act on the reloading speed, precision, and firing rate.

Another ability of battle saddles will be to shoot two guns at once, using only the amount of AP of the slower equipped gun.

It is possible that battle saddle will only be usable by non-unicorn characters, to make up for the lack of spells of the earth ponies.
If not, the earth ponies will still have bonuses when using battle saddles.

## Spelldex ##
The spelldex will be another sort of inventory, letting you pick the spell you know so you can cast them.
Once you've learned a spell, it is stored in the spelldex and can't disappear.

The details about magic using will be covered in another entry.
