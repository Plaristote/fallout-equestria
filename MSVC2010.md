# Introduction #

Greetings.
Building on Windows can be pretty frightening.
While compiling is usually a straight-forward procedure, whenever Visual Studio is involved, it gets tricky as soon as the lib you use aren't certified for a given version of Visual Studio.

I'm fairly confident even a beginner would get the game building on any Linux distribution.
But even myself, as main developer of the project, have had to work a lot to get the thing built on Windows.

This document will help you go through with the hardest stuff and you'll be left over with some clicking left and right.

## Requirements ##
An installation of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, with the Microsoft SDKs, and a little patience should be all you need.

## Why isn't it as simple as typing 'make' ? ##

The Fallout Equestria code makes a wildly use of the new C++11 standard, which was still unsupported with MSVC2008.
We had to use MSVC2010, though C++11 features are still few, and were implemented in a very clumsy fashion.

Unfortunately, Panda3D does not support MSVC2010 yet. Which means we have to compile it ourselves. And since we're doing it with an unsupported version of MSVC2010, we have some tweaking to do.

# Compiling the dependencies #

## Compiling libRocket ##

Before compiling the libRocket, you will have to make two search and replaces in all Rocket's files:

From `Factory`      to `RFactory`,
From `RFactory.hpp` to `Factory.hpp`

This will avoid a conflict with Panda3D's own `Factory` class. Even though they're not even in the same
namespace. Again, don't ask me.

Then, find the `Rocket/Core/Variant.inl` file, seek for the `GetInto` template. There's a switch down there:
you need to comment out the whole SCRIPTINTERFACE case.

### Other known issues ###
If in the `Source/Core/TextureResource.cpp` file, you get warning about an int casting to a pointer, go to that file and in the lines that the compiler marked, replace NULL with nullptr.

## Compiling Panda3D with MSVC2010 ##

This was tested with Panda3D 1.8.0:
http://www.panda3d.org/download/panda3d-1.8.0/panda3d-1.8.0-win32.zip

Open `panda/src/nativenet/socket_portable.h` and replace all the occurences to bind with ::bind. Do the same with `panda/built/include/socket_portable.h`.

Open `makepanda/makepandacore.py`, find the function SetupVisualStudioEnviron. Add these two lines
at the beginning of the function:

// Never worked on my VMs. All my VMs used WinSDK7.0. Perhaps WinSDK7.1 required ?

```
    SDK["VISUALSTUDIO"] = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\"
    SDK["MSPLATFORM"]   = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0A\\"
```

Please note that the pathes are relative to your own installation. You'll have to manually check if the pathes
are indeed correct. As far as I know, these are the default pathes for Visual Studio 2010 and the most recent Microsoft SDKs at this date, installed on a Windows 7.

To ensure a proper linking between libp3rocket and the libRocket, you should also replace the Rocket includes from `panda3d\thirdparty\win-libs-vc9\rocket\include\Rocket` with those from `librocket\include\Rocket`.

You should also look for `RocketCore.lib` and `RocketControls.lib` in your previous build of libRocket. Replace the `RocketCore.lib` and `RocketControls.lib` from `panda3d\thirdparty\win-libs-vc9\rocket\bin` with those from your custom build.

_N.B: if you are making a debug build, you need to find `RocketCore_d.lib` and `RocketControls_d.lib`, but the files you need to replace are still the same_

Now you can finally compile: at the root of the Panda3D folder, open a console prompt and run the following
command:

```
makepanda\makepanda.bat --everything --no-python --no-ode --no-opencv --no-fmodex
```

If you want to make a Debug build, run this instead:

```
makepanda\makepanda.bat --everything --no-python --no-ode --no-opencv --no-fmodex --optimize 1
```

The dlls will be in built/bin and libs in build/lib.

NOTES:
It has already occured that MSVC complained about a name conflict between... unnamed enums. Don't ask me,
ask VC's developers. This is happening in time\_base.h. Some enum defining USEC: give it an unused name
and evertyhing should be ok.

## Compiling AngelScript ##

Angelscript compiles out of the box with MSVC2010, and does not conflict with anything from other libs.
You should be good to go !

# Compiling Fallout Equestria RPG #

We use CMakeList to allow easily portable build system.

However we have no dependency detection for Windows. Actually none at all, it's only necessary for Windows I believe.

This means you'll have to:
# Generate MSVC2010 project files using CMake
# Tweak the project's settings to add include and linking directories

But first, you have to create the folder `fallout-equestria/include/Panda3D` and copy-past all the contents of `panda3d/built/include` inside.

**todo: insert cmake instructions here**

Then add the path to the following directories into the project linking and include directories:

Linking:
  1. `panda3d\build\libs`
  1. `libRocket\Build\Release`
  1. `libRocket\Build\build\RocketControls\Release`
  1. `angelscript\lib`

Include:
  1. `angelscript\include`
  1. `libRocket\include`
