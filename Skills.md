# Introduction #

This is the list of all the skills the game will implement and a short description of their influence on the games.
Skills will be used in specific actions, but can also unlock special dialogues, like in New Vegas.

This document is here to help us have a great deal of skills, like in the first Fallouts, but to make them all very useful to the game.
We also need help balancing the skills.
