# Introduction #
A good balance between characters having good, bad or neutral karma can make a lot of difference, especially if we try to create a lot of content differencing the three type of players.

# Karma #
There are two possibilities for the karma :

Karma can represent the effect of your choice over your character. Just like a skill you would train and nothing else.

But it can also be a global reputation for your character (thus helping you getting trust from some people, frightening others more easily, or getting a better success rate at bluffing, if you have either good, bad or neutral karma).

And of course, it can also be both. In any case, just like any kind of characteristics, it will grant access to different dialogue possibilities and different perks. To help people getting these perks, karma will move fast.

# Reputation #
Reputation will work like in Fallout 2 : you will have a reputation for every city you visit. Cities may be divided in several factions.
It will change the attitude of its member towards you, and at some point, they'll become hostile (pew pew hostile).

# Factions #
In the course of the game, it should be possible to join factions.
Being a member of a faction will grant you access to new kind of equipment and quests. It will also ruin your reputation towards enemy faction, and keep you from ever joining them.
