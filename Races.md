# Playable races #

Depending on what kind of game we will make, playable races will differ.

For instance, if we choose for the player to incarnate an existing Fallout Equestria character (Littlepip). In this case, it's quite impossible to let the player chose a race (or is it ? We can replay the story of Littlepip with another character... after all, Kkat decided to let the details about Littlepip to the discretion of the player, so maybe we can change a few things).

If we choose to create our own Fallout Equestria original ficiton, then there's still one problem left : the pegasi.
First of, we would have to create a fiction in which it would be plausible that our main character could be a unicorn, an earth pony or a pegasus : and since pegasi are pretty much inexistent in the wasteland, it'll be tough to come up with.

### The pegasi issue ###

Secondly, the sole existence of pegasi in the game is even in question.
The fact that they can fly leads to another bunch of problem.

There's an easy solution : we make pegasi, but they will never really fly (no ability to go over a building or something).

The hard one is to make up a whole system to allow them to go over buildings : the line of sight system may be a bit perturbed by this, and the pathfinding would need some changes.

The easiest solution, of course, is to completely ignore the pegasi in our story. But this may bring the wrath of some bronies to us :) !
Plus this would also mean for us to ignore griffins, and that would be a bit harder to justify since they're much more common in the equestrian wasteland.

# Races characteristics #
## Unicorns ##
Unicorns have the ability to use spells, and levitate weapons (thus, they can use bigger weapon without a battle saddle).

#### Statistics ####
Intelligence 4 / 12 - Charisma 4 /12


## Earth ponies ##
As per usual, nothing special about them.
Just kidding, they'll bonuses in outdoorspony abilities (it's a bit hard to balance that while staying true to friendship is magic : maybe earth ponies should have 4 main skills instead of 3, one of them being outdoorspony).

#### Statistics ####
Strength 4 / 12 - Endurance 4 /12


## Pegasi ##
Pegasi can fly. Or not. We'll see about that.

Perception 4 / 12 - Agility 4 /12
